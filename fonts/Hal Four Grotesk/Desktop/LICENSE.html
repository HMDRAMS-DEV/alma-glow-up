        <p>EULA—End User Licence Agreement
Hanzer Liccini
www.hanli.eu</p>
<p>This license agreement for Font Software becomes a legally binding contract between the licensee and Hanzer Liccini when the licensee agrees to the Terms of Condition in an electronic delivery method.  lf the licensee refuses to accept a contractual obligation through this license agreement, he is not permitted to access or use the Font Software. The licensee should thoroughly and carefully read through the complete license agreement before agreeing to the conditions specified here.</p>
<p>1 LICENSE AND USAGE RIGHTS
1.1 The Font Software underlying this contractual agreement is the intellectual property of Hanzer Liccini. The term “Font Software” includes any and all updates, upgrades, expansions, modified versions and working copies of the Font Software to which the licensee, i.e. a natural person and legal person or, within the scope of a legal person, a subsidiary with majority share, has accordingly been granted a license. The Font Software remains and shall remain, now and in the future, the property of Hanzer Liccini.
1.2 Upon full payment of the agreedupon usage fee, Hanzer Liccini grants the licensee the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to simultaneously use or store the Font Software—provided said software has been released at time of delivery or upon payment made by the licensee—on a maximum of one CPU (Workstation) stipulated by the licensee. ln the event that extensions to the above-mentioned restriction become necessary, the licensee has to purchase an extended license. The licensee may install the Font Software on a single file server for Use on a single local area network (LAN) only when the Use of such Font Software is limited to the Workstations and printers that are part of the licensed Unit of which the server is part. For the purpose of determining the proper number of Workstations for which a license is needed, the following example is supplied for illustration purposes only: lf there are 100 Workstations connected to the server, with no more than 15 Workstations either using this Font Software currently, but the Font Software will be used on 30 different Workstations at various points in time, a site license must be obtained creating a licensed Unit for 30 Workstations. The Font Software for Print (OTF) may not be installed, hosted or used on a server that can be accessed via the Internet or other external network system (a system other than LAN) by Workstations which are not part of a licensed Unit. Server-based application programs require an extended license. lf the Font Software is intended to be used for commercial purposes, each individual license permits one additional usage (installation) on a personal home or portable computer. For the exclusive purpose of data backup, additional backup copies of the Font Software can be made.
1.3 Transferring the license to a third party is essentially not permitted. By way of exception, the licensee is authorized to transfer the usage rights and license to a third party only upon compliance with all of the following conditions: The third party has expressly declared to the licensee to strictly and unrestrictedly submit and adhere to the conditions of this license agreement for Font Software. ln the event of transfer of the license to a third party, the licensee agrees and is obligated to refrain from further usage of the Font Software, and, regardless of where it is located, agrees and is obligated to delete said software and is not permitted to retain any copies, in whole or in part, of such.
1.4 For the exclusive purpose of outputting certain files, the licensee is permitted to transfer a copy of the Font Software which is used for creating the pertinent file to a commercial printer or another service company. ln the event of any text modification, the service company is required to possess its own license. The licensee has to inform the commercial printer/service company about the content of this License Agreement.
1.5 For the embedding of the Font Software into electronic documents or Internet pages a special license, next to the regular print license, is needed. This expansion/embedding license agreement is subject to an additional fee and must be singularly requested by Hanzer Liccini. Further, this kind of embedding is only permitted under the absolute assurance that the recipient cannot use the Font Software to edit or create a new document (readonly). lt must be ensured that the Font Software cannot be fully or partially extracted from said documents.
1.6 The licensee may electronically distribute Font Software embedded in a “Personal or Internal Business Use” document only when the Font Software embedded in such document is in a static graphic image (for example, a “gif”) or an embedded electronic document, and is distributed in a secure format that permits only the viewing and printing (and not the editing, altering, enhancing, or modifying) of such static graphic image or embedded document. The licensee may not embed Font Software in a Commercial Product without a separate written license from Hanzer Liccini, and the licensee may not embed Font Software in an electronic document or data file for any reason other than his own Personal or Internal Business Use.
1.7 lf the licensee intends to edit or modify a document containing the embedded Font Software, a request must be made to Hanzer Liccini who will then conclude an expansion/ embedding license agreement for said purpose. This expansion/ embedding license agreement is subject to an additional fee.
1.8 A special licence is required to use the Font Software on Ietter form goods for sale, electronic books, game playing devices, gaming or gambling devices irrespective of whether the Font Software itself is embedded into the device or whether it is merely the designs of the fonts that are displayed. lf you are using the Font Software in exhibition or display in cinemas, motion pictures, on television or on cable television, or as a part of any works broadcast or transmitted on the Internet, a special broadcasting licence is required and an additional licence fee may be required. 1.9 Webfonts are provided in the WOFF format only. lt is only allowed to use those WOFF WebFonts provided by Hanzer Liccini. lt is not allowed to use a purchased OTF print font in order to generate own Webfonts in other formats. Only WOFF web fonts may be installed on a server.</p>
<p>2 EXCLUSION OF OTHER USAGE
2.1 Subject to the provisions in subsections 1.3 and 1.4 of this agreement, selling, lending or otherwise transferring the Font Software to a third party or parties is strictly prohibited. ln addition, transferring the Font Software as a component or sub-component of other products, e.g. electronic documents or sublicenses, to a third party or parties is also strictly prohibited.
2.2 Subject to the provisions in subsections 2.3 and 2.4 of this agreement, the following is prohibited: modifying the Font Software, merging it with other software programs, decompiling it, using modules from said software for one’s own developments or using technical solutions contained in the Font Software for purposes other than operation on the licensee’s Workstation.
2.3 Exceptions to subsection 2.2 are only permitted provided they are essential to obtaining the necessary information for establishing interoperability of the software with other programs, and provided this information is neither published nor accessible in any other form and if the licensee is unable to obtain said information from Hanzer Liccini. ln this case, the licensee shall inform Hanzer Liccini in writing as to which portions of the software the licensee is decompiling.
2.4 Modifying the Font Software is prohibited, even in the event that it is necessary for fulfilling personal design requirements. lf the licensee wants to make modifications, consent and permission has to be obtained from Hanzer Liccini. Non-compliance with this provision voids any and all support rights granted by Hanzer Liccini and represents a violation and breach of this license agreement. Furthermore, if the licensee or a third party or parties effect modifications to the Font Software despite the prohibition against such modifications, Hanzer Liccini becomes the owner of that modified data. Specifically, it is prohibited to change or modify the Font/Trademark names used as identifying tags in the Font Software in any form or manner. lf such changes or modifications become necessary, prior written consent has to be obtained from Hanzer Liccini.</p>
<p>3 WARRANTY AND LIABILITY
3.1 Hanzer Liccini does not and cannot warrant the performance or results the licensee may obtain by using the Font Software. ln no event will Hanzer Liccini be liable to the licensee for any consequential, incidental or special damages, including without limitations any lost profits, lost data, lost business opportunities or lost savings.
3.2 The licensee agrees that the Font Software and all copies thereof, are owned by Hanzer Liccini; and its design, structure, organization and encoding are valuable property of Hanzer Liccini. The licensee agrees that the Font Software and Documentation are protected by German trademark and design patent laws, by the copyright and trademark laws of other countries, and by international treaties. ln addition, the licensee agrees to treat the Font Software and Documentation in the same manner corresponding to other copyrighted and trademark-protected products, e.g. books. With the exception of the points explicitly mentioned here, copying the Font Software and Documentation is not permitted. Any and all copies that the licensee is permitted to produce on the basis of this agreement have to have to contain the same copyright, trademark and other property clauses as those on or contained in the Font Software and Documentation. The licensee declares not to modify, adapt or translate the encoding of the Font Software, nor reproduce, decompile, disassemble, change, modify or otherwise attempt to reveal the source code of the Font Software. The licensee also agrees to use the Trademarks that are connected to the Font Software, accordingly to accept usage of the Trademarks (including the identification of the owner of the respective Trademark). Trademarks can be used solely for the purpose of identifying printed data from the Font Software. The licensee is also aware that software is never completely error-free and that the Font Software may therefore contain errors which can affect functionality and operation.
3.3 Claims exceeding the preceding warranty claims, e.g. compensation for idle time, loss of production, waste of material and other indirect damage, are explicitly excluded, provided said damage was not willfully or intentionally brought about or caused by gross negligence on the part of Hanzer Liccini. Liability is not assumed insofar as the damage does not stem from a grossly negligent breach of duty by Hanzer Liccini or is not caused by a willful, intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty on the part of one of Hanzer Liccini’s legal representatives. 3.4 Hanzer Liccini’s fonts are not made for Windows systems and Microsoft Office. There will be no warranty for any problems caused on those operating platforms or Microsoft related programs.</p>
<p>4 TERMINATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT
4.1 The license and usage right guaranteed under subsection 1.2 shall become immediately null and void in the event of a breach of this contract.
4.2 lf the licensee or one of the licensee’s employees breaches the agreedupon license and right of use and/or property rights of Hanzer Liccini, Hanzer Liccini has the right to terminate the license and right of use, with termination taking immediate effect. Hanzer Liccini reserves the explicit right to assert any further claims (specifically Information, compensation for damages, etc.).
4.3 ln the event of termination, the licensee is obligated to delete and return to Hanzer Liccini the original Font Software affected by and pertaining to the termination, including Documentation and all copies. At the request of Hanzer Liccini, the licensee is obligated to provide written assurance that said deletion has occurred. 4.4 ln case single regulations of this contract become invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions of this contract will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>5 CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATION
5.1 The licensee is obligated to undertake all necessary steps to prevent unauthorized access to the Font Software and to any copies of such.
5.2 lf the licensee grants his or her employees or representatives access to the Font Software, the licensee has to specifically inform them of the content and conditions of the license provisions for the relevant Font Software and put said employees or representatives under the obligation of compliance with those provisions and conditions.</p>
<p>6 FINAL PROVISIONS
6.1 This contract represents an agreement between the parties. Verbal collateral agreements do not exist. Any verbal agreements are only binding for Hanzer Liccini if said verbal agreements have been acknowledged and confirmed in writing by Hanzer Liccini. Changes to this contract require written form. This also applies to changes to this written form clause.
6.2 Any and all disputes arising from, or in connection with, this contract as well as any dispute over the materialization of this contract are exclusively subject to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The rights and Obligations of the parties arising from this contract are based on German law, even in the event that the exertion or breach of contractual rights takes place in a foreign country.
