export const MEAL_GLOW_UP_PROMPT = `Transform this meal into a stunning Bon Appétit magazine cover-worthy gourmet dish. This is a creative culinary elevation that MUST preserve and prominently showcase EVERY ingredient visible in the original photo.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - INGREDIENT PRESERVATION:
- IDENTIFY EVERY INGREDIENT: List and recognize all ingredients visible in the original photo
- PRESERVE ALL INGREDIENTS: Every single ingredient must remain visible and recognizable in the transformed image
- SHOWCASE EACH INGREDIENT: Each ingredient should be elevated, refined, and showcased beautifully - not hidden or removed
- NO SUBSTITUTIONS: Do not replace ingredients with different ones; only enhance what's already there
- INGREDIENT VISIBILITY: Make sure viewers can clearly identify each original ingredient in the gourmet version

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY & ELEVATE:
Carefully identify every ingredient in the dish. Then transform the plating to showcase each ingredient as a gourmet component: arrange them with precision, enhance their natural colors and textures, and present them as refined elements of a chef-crafted creation. Each ingredient should look more appetizing, refined, and premium than the original.

STEP 2 - GOURMET PLATING WITH INGREDIENT FOCUS:
- Arrange all ingredients in a refined, intentional composition that highlights their individual beauty
- Enhance the quality of each ingredient: make vegetables crisper, proteins glossier, sauces more refined
- Add complementary gourmet touches around the main ingredients: micro-garnishes, herb oils, artisanal accents
- Use negative space to elegantly separate and showcase individual ingredients
- Create color harmony that makes every ingredient pop: vibrant greens, rich sauces, golden-brown proteins, etc.
- Every ingredient from the original must be distinguishable in the final image

STEP 3 - PROFESSIONAL FOOD PHOTOGRAPHY:
- Shot style: Bon Appétit editorial photography - magazine-cover worthy, dynamic, crave-inducing
- Lighting: Warm directional side-window lighting emphasizing texture and dimension of each ingredient
- Perspective: 30-45° angle or overhead hero shot that best showcases all ingredients clearly
- Depth of field: Shallow DOF (f/2.8-f/4) with all main ingredients in crisp focus
- Camera simulation: 85mm lens equivalent, warm color temperature (3200-4500K), low noise

STEP 4 - STYLING & PREMIUM PRESENTATION:
- Background: Luxury surface (marble, slate, premium linen) or elegant fine dining environment
- Props: Minimal and refined - don't distract from the beautifully plated ingredients
- Texture details: Emphasize the surface quality of each ingredient - glossy proteins, crisp vegetables, fresh herbs
- Premium touches: Add refined garnishes that complement the original ingredients (microgreens, herb oil, premium salts)

STEP 5 - FINAL EXECUTION:
- Ensure every ingredient from the original is still clearly visible and identifiable
- Make the image magazine-cover worthy and instantly crave-inducing
- Professional restaurant photography standard with editorial quality
- The transformation should say: "This is elevated, refined, and delicious" - not "This is a completely different dish"

The goal: Make this dish look like it came straight from a Michelin-starred kitchen, where every ingredient is honored, refined, and beautifully presented on a magazine cover.`;
