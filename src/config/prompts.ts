export const MEAL_GLOW_UP_PROMPT = `Transform this meal photo into a stunning, high-end fine dining dish shot with professional food-photography techniques.  
Maintain the core ingredients so the dish remains recognizable.  
Elevate every element with refined textures, elegant geometry, and precise plating.  
Use the aesthetic of a modern Michelin-starred restaurant: soft directional side-window lighting, shallow depth of field, realistic steam or moisture, perfect lighting and appetizing colours.  
Simulate a hero lens look (≈85 mm full-frame equivalent) with shallow depth of field (for example f/2.8-f/5.6) to isolate the dish and gently blur the background.  
Keep ISO as low as possible (equivalent to ISO 100-400) to preserve texture, minimise noise.  
Use a shutter‐like speed that ensures sharp focus (equivalent to ≥ 1/60 s if handheld, faster if motion is implied) so the image is crisp.  
Framing: choose a 30° to 45° angle to the plate (not flat lay unless the dish is strictly flat), centred composition with negative space.  
Plate style: clean rim, minimal props, a single hero component, micro-herb garnishes, well-balanced colour palette with contrasts (e.g., vivid greens, rich browns, light sauce drizzle).  
Background: minimal and unobtrusive, either neutral matte surface or soft low-contrast environment.  
Texture and detail: emphasise surface textures (crisp edges, glaze highlights, fresh herbs), natural light reflection on sauces or moisture.  
Post-production style: subtle polish, realistic lighting and shadow fall-off, no surreal or cartoonish materials; treat like a restaurant campaign shot, not a stylised illustration.  
Ensure the final transformation looks photorealistic, with true-to-life food textures, believable plating physics, and premium food-photo quality.  `;
