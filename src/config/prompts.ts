export const MEAL_GLOW_UP_PROMPT = `Transform this meal into a show-stopping Bon Appétit magazine cover-worthy dish. This is a creative culinary transformation, not just a photo enhancement.

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY & REIMAGINE:
Identify the core ingredients and main dish type. Then reimagine it as an elevated gourmet version: enhance flavors through creative plating, add sophisticated elements (premium garnishes, architectural composition, luxurious sauces, edible flowers, microgreens, gold leaf accents if appropriate), and present it as a chef's signature creation.

STEP 2 - CREATIVE PLATING & PRESENTATION:
- Transform the plating into fine dining artistry: use negative space strategically, create geometric or organic arrangements
- Add gourmet touches: edible flowers, microgreens, herb oil drizzles, micro-salt crystals, sauce swooshes
- Elevate the presentation with premium elements (saffron threads, edible gold, premium greens, artisanal garnishes)
- Consider the color harmony and create visual contrast with vibrant fresh ingredients

STEP 3 - PROFESSIONAL FOOD PHOTOGRAPHY:
- Shot style: Bon Appétit editorial photography - dynamic, inspiring, appetite-inducing
- Lighting: Warm directional side-window lighting with subtle golden highlights, creating depth and dimension
- Perspective: 30-45° angle or overhead hero shot depending on dish shape, with confident composition
- Depth of field: Shallow DOF (f/2.8-f/4) isolating the hero dish with softly blurred premium plating background
- Camera simulation: 85mm lens equivalent, crisp focus, warm color temperature (3200-4500K), minimal noise

STEP 4 - STYLING & ATMOSPHERE:
- Background: Luxury surface (marble, slate, linen) or curated fine dining environment
- Props: Minimal, refined - maybe a linen napkin, fine china edge, or wine glass hint
- Texture details: Emphasize glossy glazes, crisp textures, fresh herb detail, sauce reflections, steam wisps
- Color palette: Rich, sophisticated, with warm ambient tones that make the food irresistible

STEP 5 - FINAL POLISH:
- Ensure photorealistic quality with true-to-life food textures and believable plating
- Add subtle atmospheric effects: soft focus backgrounds, warm light reflection, premium feel
- Create an image that would make someone want to immediately order or recreate this dish
- Professional restaurant photography standard with editorial magazine quality

KEY CREATIVE FREEDOMS: You have full creative liberty to:
- Add sophisticated plating elements beyond the original
- Enhance ingredients with gourmet alternatives or premium presentation
- Create new sauce presentations or garnish arrangements
- Transform simple meals into chef-crafted creations
- Make it magazine-cover worthy and utterly crave-inducing

The goal: Make this dish look like it just came out of a Michelin-starred kitchen and belongs on a magazine cover.`;
